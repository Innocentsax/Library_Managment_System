- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automates Docker builds and pushes to Docker Hub.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation with Swagger.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following setup:
- Java 17
- Docker
- Maven
- GitHub account

### Build and Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Innocentsax/Library_Managment_System.git
    cd library-management-system
    ```

2. **Build the project using Maven**:
    ```sh
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```sh
    java -jar target/library-managment-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```


## üìú Logging

This project uses SLF4J with Logback for logging. The log configuration can be found in `src/main/resources/logback.xml`.

### Logback Configuration

The Logback configuration specifies the logging pattern, log file location, and log rotation policy. You can customize the configuration to suit your needs.

### Accessing Logs

Logs are written to both the console and a log file located at `logs/library-management-system.log`. The log file is rotated daily, and log files older than 30 days are automatically deleted.

### Logging Levels

The logging levels used in the project are:
- `INFO`: General application information.
- `DEBUG`: Detailed information used for debugging purposes.
- `ERROR`: Error messages indicating that something went wrong.

You can adjust the logging levels in the Logback configuration file to control the verbosity of the logs.

### Viewing Logs

To view the logs, you can either:
- Check the console output when running the application.
- Open the log file located at `logs/library-management-system.log`.

## üöÄ Testing

### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Library Management System. The tests can be run using Maven, and the results will be generated in a report format.

**Running Tests:**

To run the unit tests, execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
mvn test
```

### Test Status Badges

You can monitor the status of your tests using badges that show the build status and test coverage. These badges will be updated automatically with each commit to the repository.
